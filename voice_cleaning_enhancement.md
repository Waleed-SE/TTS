## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

- Updated `clean_voice_sample()` function with granular parameters
- Modified `convert_pdf_to_speech_voice_clone()` to accept individual cleaning options
- Enhanced `streamlit_pdf_to_speech_clone()` wrapper function

### Parameter Flow

```
Streamlit UI → streamlit_pdf_to_speech_clone() → convert_pdf_to_speech_voice_clone() → clean_voice_sample()
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. High-Quality Production

- Enable all cleaning features
- Use for final audio output

### 2. Quick Testing

- Disable cleaning for faster processing
- Good for testing voice compatibility

### 3. Custom Processing

- Enable only specific features based on voice sample quality
- Fine-tune for different audio sources

### 4. Noisy Environments

- May disable normalization if volume is already good

## 📊 Performance Impact

| Feature             | Processing Time | Quality Improvement | File Size Impact |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Noise Reduction     | +2-3 seconds    | High                | -10-20%          |
